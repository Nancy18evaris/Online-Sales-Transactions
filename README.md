The dataset is sourced from Kaggle.This dataset is an online transactions dataset. The information provided in it includes:
Order ID: A unique identifier for the sales order.
Date: The date of the sales transaction.
Category: The brand category of the product sold.
Product Name: The specified name or model of the product sold.
Quantity: The number of units of the product sold.
Unit Price: The price per unit of the product.
Total Price: The total price of the transaction.
Geographical Region: Specifies whether the transaction is from Europe, North America, or Asia.
Payment Method: The payment type used—Credit Card, PayPal, or Debit Card.

I read the above dataset. It is an online transactions dataset. What I understood from it is that, it is a supervised machine learning dataset. From this dataset i confirm that it is a Supervised Machine Learning as it contains a dependent column.I consider the payment column as the dependent column,and  all the other columns as the independent columns. So, this is an example of a Categorical Supervised Machine learning.The payment column is categorized with only three categories: debit card, credit card, and PayPal. 

In this same dataset, if I consider Total Revenue as the dependent column and consider all other columns as independent , I can determine which category has generated the most revenue." From this dataset i confirm, that it is a Supervised Machine Learning as it contains a dependent column. So, this is an example of a Regression or Continuous Supervised Machine learning as the revenue column is infinite and continuous.

Scenario 1: Classification Problem
Dependent Variable (Target): Payment Method (Categorical: Credit Card, PayPal, Debit Card)
Independent Variables (Features): Order ID, Date, Category, Product Name, Quantity, Unit Price, Total Price, Geographical Region.
Type of Learning: Categorical Supervised Machine Learning (Classification)
Algorithms to Use:Logistic Regression (Baseline Model), Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost 

Scenario 2: Regression Problem
Dependent Variable (Target): Total Revenue (Continuous Variable)
Independent Variables (Features): Order ID, Date, Category, Product Name, Quantity, Unit Price, Geographical Region, Payment Method.
Type of Learning: Continuous Supervised Machine Learning (Regression)
Algorithms to Use:Linear Regression (Baseline Model), Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, XGBoost Regressor, Gradient Boosting Regressor

Key Takeaways:
✅ Classification if the target is categorical (e.g., Payment Method).
✅ Regression if the target is continuous (e.g., Total Revenue).
